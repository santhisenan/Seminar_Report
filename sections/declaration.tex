        I undersigned hereby declare that the seminar report 
        "Generative Adversarial Networks", submitted for partial fulfilment of 
        the requirements for the award of degree of Bachelor of Technology of 
        the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, Kerala is a bona fide work 
        done by me under supervision of Dr. Ajeesh Ramanujan. This submission 
        represents my ideas in my own words and where ideas or words of others 
        have been included, I have adequately and accurately cited and 
        referenced the original sources. I also declare that I have adhered to 
        ethics of academic honesty and integrity and have not misrepresented or 
        fabricated any data or idea or fact or source in my submission. I 
        understand that any violation of the above will be a cause for 
        disciplinary action by the institute and/or the University and can also 
        evoke penal action from the sources which have thus not been properly 
        cited or from whom proper permission has not been obtained. This report 
        has not been previously formed the basis for the award of any degree, 
        diploma or similar title of any other University.\\
